## :wrench: Developer set up
1. Install npm and node.js


## :eyes: Lessons Learned 
1. To open html on Chrome
```bash
$ open ./src/index.html
```

2. Normally we would only have the index.html at the root directory and all other HTML files in their own directory.

Good analogy: 
    Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html).
